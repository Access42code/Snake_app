Description.


Snake is a classic arcade game played by millions of people around the world. The game is easy to use but challenging to master. The goal of the game is to control the snake so that it eats as much food as possible while avoiding colliding with itself or the walls.

The game starts with a short snake that is located in the center of the playing field. The player controls the snake with the arrows on the keyboard. The snake moves in the direction of the arrow. When the snake eats food, it grows. The longer the snake is, the harder it is to control.

If the snake collides with itself or the walls, the game ends. The player can restart the game or continue the game from the same place where they left off.
